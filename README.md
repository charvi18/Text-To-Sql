🧠 Text to SQL Query Generator

A Text-to-SQL Web Application that converts natural language queries into SQL statements using a simple and intuitive web interface. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and Python (Flask) for backend processing.

This application helps users interact with databases without writing SQL manually, making it beginner-friendly and useful for learning database querying concepts.

📌 Project Overview

The Text-to-SQL project allows users to enter plain English questions (e.g., “Show all students with marks above 80”) and converts them into corresponding SQL queries. The system demonstrates how natural language input can be mapped to structured database queries.

The frontend provides login and registration pages for user access, while the backend handles query processing logic.
